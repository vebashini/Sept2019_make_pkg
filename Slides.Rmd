# What's a package anyway?

Packages are organised units of reproducible R code. 

A _package_ includes:
- __R functions__<sup>1</sup>: abstraction of details - user only needs to know what inputs and outputs are needed.
- __Documentation__: describing how to use the functions.
- __Data__.

It's a _friendly_ way to distribute your code, or even _reuse_ it yourself! 

.footnote[
[1] We expose __user-facing functions__, so the user/future you does not need to be concerned with the supporting/helper functions.

# Ways to install a package<sup>1</sup>

* Packages are mainly stored on [Comprehensive R Archive Network aka CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_name.html) --> we install these using:
Menu Item `Tools -> Install Packages ...` OR
```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
          install.packages('ggplot2')
```
* There are also many packages on GitHub --> we install these using a helper package `devtools`:
```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
          install.packages('devtools')
          devtools::install_github("sciencificity/werpals")
```
          
Then we load the package to make the functionality available using:
```{r eval=FALSE, tidy=FALSE}
  library(werpals)
```
        
.footnote[
[1] Further to these there's [bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/), but having never worked with it I just mention it here for those interested.

# Name that thing

### Formal Naming Requirements
- must only consist of letters, numbers and periods i.e.  `.`; 
- it must start with a letter; and
- it cannot end with a period. 

You can’t use either hyphens or underscores in the package name. 
]

__Other Tips:__
- It is recommended to avoid using periods, in the package name as it is easily confused with function names in the OO system of R.
- Find a name that is easy to Google.
-

- Create a new R Project from the menu 

`File -> New Project -> New Directory -> R Package`

# Structure of a package
- DESCRIPTION : the metadata of the package (package name, version, author, maintainer, dependencies etc.)
- NAMESPACE : how your package interacts with R and with other packages
- R/ : the code
- man/ : the documentation
- data/ : data
- tests : the tests
- vignettes : the vignettes
- .Rbuildignore : a description of what will be ignored when the package is built

# Git - Some tips & Useful commands (Windows)

## Using Git Bash or the Terminal window in RStudio
- `pwd`: Tells you where you are currently, literally print working directory.
<img src = "./git1.png" width = 300px>

- `ls`: Gives you a list of files and folders in your current working directory.
<img src = "./git2.png" width = 600px>

- `mkdir name_of_folder`: Makes a new directory called **name_of_folder** in the current working directory.
<img src = "./git3.png" width = 600px>

---
# Git - Some tips & Useful commands continued ...
- `cd name_of_folder`: Places you in the **name_of_folder** directory.
<img src = "./git4.PNG" width = 400px>

- `git init`: Initialises a git repo in the directory you run the command from. You should now see a .git folder if you run `ls` after the initialisation.
<img src = "./git5.PNG" width = 420px>

- `git config user.name "Firstname Surname"` AND `git config user.email "test@testexample.com"`: Adds the user name and email address to the config file.
<img src = "./git6.PNG" width = 500px>

---
# Git - Some tips & Useful commands continued ...
- `cat .git/config`: Displays the contents of the config file.
